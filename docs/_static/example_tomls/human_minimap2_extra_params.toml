# Summary: This example configuration demonstrates passing additional parameters through to the aligner.
# These parametes can be used to fine tune the alignment process.
# In this case we are setting the best_n parameter to 1, which will
# cause mappy to only report the best alignment for each read.
# This is useful for reducing the size of the output file.
# See the mappy documentation (https://github.com/lh3/minimap2/tree/master/python)
# for more details on the parameters that can be passed through.
# This example is configured for running with r10.4.1 flowcells and 5khz sample rate.


# Genomic targets are specified directly in the toml file in the form
#   "contig"
# or as:
#   "contig,start,end,strand"
# for example, "chr2,0,100,+"" or "chr2".
# If chr2 is specified, the entire contig will be considered a target, on both strands.
# These patterns can be mixed, both in the toml or in a .csv file.


# All of the below fields are explained in more detail in the documentation -
# https://looselab.github.io/readfish/toml.html

# Basecaller configuration
[caller_settings.guppy]
#               ^^^^^^ - ".guppy" specifies our chosen basecaller
# Guppy base-calling configuration file name

# Address of the guppy basecaller - The default address for guppy is ipc:///tmp/.guppy/5555.
address = "ipc:///tmp/.guppy/5555"
# Fastq output for individual reads. This is OPTIONAL - as these files can become quite large.
# Remove line to disable.
debug_log = "live_reads.fq"

# Aligner Configuration
[mapper_settings.mappy]
#               ^^^^^^ - ".mappy" specifies mappy or mappy-rs as the aligner
# Alignment reference to use. Should be either FASTA or an MMI
fn_idx_in = "/path/to/hg38.mmi"
# Optional PAF output for live alignments.
# Remove line to disable.

# Number of threads for indexing (mappy and mappy-rs) and mapping (mappy-rs only)

# Number of alignments to report for each read.
# As this parameter is not recognised by readfish, it is passed through to the mappy Aligner,
# when it is initialised.

# Region Configuration - see https://looselab.github.io/readfish/toml.html#analysis-regions for more information.
# Definitions of "unblock", "proceed" and "stop_receivings" are as follows

    # proceed: Allow one more chunk to be captured, before trying to make another decision, i.e proceed for now

    # unblock: Unblock the read

    # stop_receiving: Allow the read to be sequenced, and stop receiving signal chunks for it.
# This region will enrich for reads mapping to chr20 and chr21.
