"""unblock_all.py

ReadUntil implementation that will only unblock reads. This should result in
a read length histogram that has very short peaks (~280-580bp) as these are the
smallest chunks that we can acquire. If you are not seeing these peaks, the
`split_reads_after_seconds` parameter in the configuration file may need to be
edited to 0.2-0.4.
